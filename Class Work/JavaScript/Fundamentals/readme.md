# üìò JavaScript Notes

This document contains key JavaScript concepts explained with **definitions** and **examples**.

---

## üîπ History of JavaScript

- JavaScript was created in **1995** by **Brendan Eich** while working at **Netscape**.
- Originally called **Mocha**, then renamed **LiveScript**, and finally **JavaScript**.
- Standardized by **ECMA International** as **ECMAScript** in **1997**.
- Today, JavaScript is one of the most widely used programming languages for both **frontend** and **backend** development.

**Example:**

```js
console.log("Hello, JavaScript World!");
```

---

## üîπ Garbage Collection

- JavaScript uses **automatic garbage collection**.
- Garbage collector frees memory that is no longer referenced.
- You don‚Äôt manually allocate or deallocate memory (like in C/C++).

**Example:**

```js
let obj = { name: "Chandi" };
obj = null; // Garbage collector frees memory
```

---

## üîπ Mark & Sweep Algorithm

- The most common garbage collection technique in JS.
- Process:
  1. **Mark**: Find all objects that are still reachable from the **root (window/global)**.
  2. **Sweep**: Remove objects that are not marked (unreachable).

**Example:**

```js
function createUser() {
  let user = { name: "John" };
  return user;
}

let person = createUser();
person = null; // Not reachable ‚Üí garbage collected
```

---

## üîπ How JavaScript Code Runs

- JavaScript runs inside the **JavaScript Engine** (e.g., V8 in Chrome, SpiderMonkey in Firefox).
- Uses **Execution Contexts**:
  1. **Global Execution Context (GEC)** ‚Üí Created by default.
  2. **Function Execution Context (FEC)** ‚Üí Created when a function is invoked.
- Uses **Call Stack** to manage execution.

**Example:**

```js
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello World");
}

greet(); // Push to call stack ‚Üí Execute ‚Üí Pop out
```

---

## üîπ Prototyping in JavaScript

- Every object in JS has a hidden property called **`__proto__`**.
- Used for **prototype chaining** (inheritance).

**Example:**

```js
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Person.prototype.sayHello = function () {
  console.log("Hello, my name is " + this.name);
};

let user = new Person("Chandi");
user.sayHello(); // "Hello, my name is Chandi"
```

---

## üîπ Objects and Null in Window Object

- In browsers, the **`window` object** is the global object.
- All global variables and functions become properties of `window`.
- `null` represents an **intentional absence** of any object value.

**Example:**

```js
console.log(window.document); // DOM object
let myVar = 10;
console.log(window.myVar); // 10

let data = null;
console.log(data); // null
```

---

## üîπ Memory Management

- JS allocates memory when objects are created.
- Memory is automatically released when objects are no longer needed.
- Techniques:
  - **Avoid memory leaks** (don‚Äôt keep unnecessary references).
  - **Use local variables** (they are garbage collected when function exits).

**Example:**

```js
function process() {
  let temp = { largeData: new Array(1000000).fill("data") };
  console.log("Processing...");
}

process(); // temp goes out of scope ‚Üí garbage collected
```

## üß† Memory Allocation in JavaScript

JavaScript handles memory automatically with two main types of memory:

1. **Stack Memory** ‚Äì Stores **primitive values** (numbers, strings, booleans, `null`, `undefined`, `symbol`, `bigint`).
   - Stored by **value**.
   - Fast and lightweight.
2. **Heap Memory** ‚Äì Stores **reference types** (objects, arrays, functions).
   - Stored by **reference** (the variable points to a memory address).
   - Larger and dynamically allocated.

### Example:

```javascript
// Stack (Primitive)
let x = 10;
let y = x; // y copies the value of x
y = 20;

console.log(x); // 10
console.log(y); // 20

// Heap (Reference)
let obj1 = { name: "Chandi" };
let obj2 = obj1; // obj2 points to the same memory location

obj2.name = "Mahato";
console.log(obj1.name); // "Mahato" (changed in both)
```

## üìã Shallow Copy

A Shallow Copy creates a new object, but it only copies references to nested objects instead of duplicating them.

Changes in nested objects affect both copies.

Methods for Shallow Copy:

Object.assign()

Spread Operator (...)

Example:

```javascript
let obj1 = { name: "Chandi", address: { city: "Noida" } };

// Shallow copy using spread operator
let obj2 = { ...obj1 };

obj2.address.city = "Delhi";

console.log(obj1.address.city); // "Delhi" (changed in both)
console.log(obj2.address.city); // "Delhi"
```

## üìã Deep Copy

A Deep Copy duplicates the object and all nested objects, creating a completely independent copy.

Changes in nested objects do not affect the original.

Methods for Deep Copy:

```javaScript
structuredClone() (modern, preferred)

JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj)) (but loses functions, undefined, Date, etc.)

Libraries like lodash.cloneDeep()

Example:
let obj1 = { name: "Chandi", address: { city: "Noida" } };

// Deep copy using JSON
let obj2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj1));

obj2.address.city = "Delhi";

console.log(obj1.address.city); // "Noida" (unchanged)
console.log(obj2.address.city); // "Delhi"

// ‚úÖ Modern Deep Copy
let obj3 = structuredClone(obj1);
obj3.address.city = "Mumbai";

console.log(obj1.address.city); // "Noida"
console.log(obj3.address.city); // "Mumbai"
```

# üìò JavaScript: Memory Allocation & Code Execution (TOA)

---

## üß† Memory Allocation in JavaScript

**Definition:**  
Memory allocation in JavaScript is the process where the JavaScript engine reserves memory for variables, functions, and objects during program execution.  
JavaScript uses **two main types of memory**:

- **Stack Memory (Primitive types)**
- **Heap Memory (Reference types like objects, arrays, functions)**

### üîπ Stack Memory

- Stores **primitive values** (`number`, `string`, `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`, `symbol`, `bigint`).
- Works on **Last In First Out (LIFO)**.
- Faster access.

### üîπ Heap Memory

- Stores **non-primitive/reference values** (Objects, Arrays, Functions).
- References (addresses) are kept in stack, actual data in heap.
- Larger but slower than stack.

### ‚úÖ Example: Memory Allocation

```javascript
// Stack Memory (Primitive types)
let a = 10;
let b = a;
b = 20;

console.log(a); // 10 (not changed, because primitive values are copied)
console.log(b); // 20

// Heap Memory (Reference types)
let obj1 = { name: "Chandi" };
let obj2 = obj1; // Copying reference

obj2.name = "Charan";

console.log(obj1.name); // "Charan" (both point to same memory in heap)
console.log(obj2.name); // "Charan"
```

# ‚ö° Code Execution in JavaScript (TOA)

---

## üìñ Definition

JavaScript follows a **single-threaded, synchronous execution model** with the help of the **Execution Context** and the **Call Stack**.  
This process is managed by the **JavaScript Engine** (e.g., V8 in Chrome).

---

## üîπ Execution Context

Execution Context is the **environment** where JavaScript code is evaluated and executed.

It has **two phases**:

### 1. Memory Creation Phase (Hoisting / Memory Allocation)

- Variables are allocated memory in the **Global/Local Scope**.
- Functions are stored in memory with their **entire definition**.
- Variables are initialized with:
  - `undefined` (if declared with `var`)
  - **TDZ (Temporal Dead Zone)** if declared with `let` or `const`.

### 2. Code Execution Phase

- Code executes **line by line**.
- Variables get assigned their **actual values**.
- Function calls create new **Function Execution Contexts (FEC)**.

---

## üîπ Call Stack

- JavaScript uses a **Call Stack** (LIFO ‚Äì Last In, First Out) to track function execution.
- Each function call creates a **Function Execution Context (FEC)**, which gets **pushed** onto the stack.
- When the function finishes, its context is **popped out**.

---

## ‚úÖ Example: Code Execution (TOA)

```javascript
console.log("Start");

function greet(name) {
  console.log("Hello " + name);
}

function main() {
  let user = "Chandi"; // Memory allocated (undefined ‚Üí "Chandi")
  greet(user); // Function Execution Context created
}

main();

console.log("End");
```

### üìå Execution Breakdown

1. Global Execution Context (GEC) created

   - Memory allocated:
     - greet ‚Üí function definition
     - main ‚Üí function definition
     - console ‚Üí object

2. Code Execution
   - console.log("Start") ‚Üí prints "Start"
   - main() called ‚Üí new FEC pushed
     - Inside main: user = "Chandi"
     - greet(user) ‚Üí new FEC pushed
       - Executes console.log("Hello Chandi")
       - Pops out of stack
     - main finishes ‚Üí pops out
   - console.log("End") ‚Üí prints "End"

```sql
Start
Hello Chandi
End
```

## üìù Summary

- Memory Allocation: Happens in two phases ‚Üí Stack (primitive) & Heap (reference).

- Code Execution (TOA): Controlled by Execution Context + Call Stack.

- Execution Context Phases:
  1. Memory Creation (Hoisting)
  2. Code Execution

# üåê Global Execution Context (GEC) in JavaScript

The **Global Execution Context (GEC)** is the **default execution context** created by the JavaScript engine when a program starts running.  
Every JavaScript program starts with the GEC.

---

## ‚ú® Key Points about GEC

1. **Created at the beginning** of code execution.
2. There is always **only one GEC** in a program.
3. It consists of **two main phases**:
   - **Memory Creation Phase (Creation Phase)**
   - **Code Execution Phase (Execution Phase)**

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Structure of GEC

The GEC has two parts:

1. **Memory Component (Variable Environment)**

   - Stores variables and function declarations as key-value pairs.
   - Functions are stored with their entire code, variables are set to `undefined`.

2. **Code Component (Thread of Execution)**
   - Executes code line by line.
   - Assigns actual values to variables and executes functions.

---

## üîÑ Phases of GEC

### 1. **Memory Creation Phase**

- Variables are allocated memory and initialized with `undefined`.
- Function declarations are stored as the whole function.
- Example:
  ```js
  console.log(a); // undefined
  var a = 10;
  function greet() {
    console.log("Hello!");
  }
  ```

### Memory:

    - a: undefined
    - greet: function(){...}

2. Code Execution Phase

- Variables get their actual values.
- Functions are executed when invoked.

```javascript
console.log(a); // undefined
var a = 10;
greet(); // "Hello!"

function greet() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}
```

## üåç Global Object and this

    - In browser, the global object is window.
    - In Node.js, the global object is global.
    - Inside GEC:
        - this points to the global object.
        - Example:

        ```javascript
        console.log(this);  // window (in browsers)
        ```

### üì¶ Example of GEC

```javascript
var x = 5;

function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

console.log(x); // 5
console.log(add(2, 3)); // 5
```

**Memory Phase:\***

    - x: undefined
    - add: function(){...}

**_Execution Phase:_**

    - x = 5
    - console.log(x) ‚Üí 5
    - add(2,3) ‚Üí 5

# üìå JavaScript Data Types

JavaScript is **dynamically typed**, meaning variables can hold values of any type and can change at runtime.  
Data types define the kind of values that can be stored and manipulated in JavaScript.

---

## üîπ 1. Primitive Data Types

Primitive types are **immutable** and represent single values.

### (a) Number

Represents integers and floating-point numbers.  
Special values: `Infinity`, `-Infinity`, `NaN`.

```javascript
let age = 25;
let price = 99.99;
let infinity = Infinity;
let notNumber = NaN;
```

### (b) String

Represents a sequence of characters.
Enclosed in ' ', " ", or ` ` (template literals).

```javascript
let name = "Chandi";
let message = "Hello World";
let greeting = `Hi, ${name}!`;
```

### (c) Boolean

Logical values: true or false.

```javascript
let isLoggedIn = true;
let isVerified = false;
```

### (d) Undefined

A variable declared but not assigned a value.

```javascript
let score;
console.log(score); // undefined
```

### (e) Null

Represents the intentional absence of value.

```javascript
let data = null;
```

### (f) Symbol (ES6)

Unique and immutable identifier.

```javascript
let id = Symbol("userID");
let obj = { [id]: 123 };
```

### (g) BigInt (ES11 / 2020)

Handles very large integers beyond Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER.

```javascript
let big = 123456789012345678901234567890n;
```

## üîπ 2. Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types

These hold references and are mutable.

### (a) Object

Collection of key-value pairs.

```javascript
let person = {
  name: "Chandi",
  age: 23,
  isStudent: true,
};
```

### (b) Array

Ordered list of values.

```javascript
let fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Mango"];
```

### (c) Function

First-class objects (can be assigned, passed, or returned).

```javascript
function greet() {
  return "Hello!";
}
```

### (d) Other Built-in Objects

Date, RegExp, Map, Set, WeakMap, WeakSet.

```javascript
let date = new Date();
let regex = /abc/;
let map = new Map();
let set = new Set([1, 2, 3]);
```

### üìä Summary Table

Type Category Example
Number Primitive let x = 42;
String Primitive let s = "Hello";
Boolean Primitive let isOk = true;
Undefined Primitive let a;
Null Primitive let b = null;
Symbol Primitive let id = Symbol("id");
BigInt Primitive let big = 123n;
Object Non-Primitive let obj = {name:"JS"};
Array Non-Primitive let arr = [1,2,3];
Function Non-Primitive function fn() {}

### ‚úÖ Interview Tips

JavaScript has 7 primitive types + 1 non-primitive type (Object).

Arrays, functions, dates, regex, etc. are all Objects.

‚ö†Ô∏è typeof null ‚Üí "object" (known JavaScript bug).

# üìå JavaScript Data Types

```

# ‚ö° Hoisting in JavaScript

## üìå Definition

**Hoisting** in JavaScript is a mechanism where **variable and function declarations** are moved to the top of their scope (script or function) **before execution**.  
This means you can use variables and functions **before they are declared** in the code.

‚ö†Ô∏è Only **declarations** are hoisted, not **initializations**.

---

## üîπ 1. Hoisting with `var`

Variables declared with `var` are **hoisted** and initialized with `undefined`.

```javascript
console.log(a); // undefined
var a = 10;
console.log(a); // 10
```

üëâ Behind the scenes:

```javascript
var a; // declaration is hoisted
console.log(a); // undefined
a = 10; // initialization stays in place
console.log(a); // 10
```

## üîπ 2. Hoisting with let and const

Variables declared with let and const are hoisted but placed in a Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) until initialized.

Accessing them before declaration results in a ReferenceError.

```javascript
console.log(x); // ReferenceError
let x = 5;

console.log(y); // ReferenceError
const y = 15;
```

---

## üîπ 3. Function Hoisting

Function Declarations are hoisted completely (you can call them before definition).

Function Expressions (assigned to var, let, or const) are treated like variables and follow variable hoisting rules.

```javascript
Function Declaration (Hoisted ‚úÖ)
greet(); // "Hello!"

function greet() {
console.log("Hello!");
}

Function Expression (Not Hoisted ‚ùå)
sayHi(); // TypeError: sayHi is not a function

var sayHi = function() {
console.log("Hi!");
};
```

## üìä Summary Table

Keyword/Type Hoisted? Default Value Access Before Declaration
var ‚úÖ Yes undefined Allowed (gives undefined)
let ‚úÖ Yes Uninitialized ‚ùå ReferenceError (TDZ)
const ‚úÖ Yes Uninitialized ‚ùå ReferenceError (TDZ)
Function Declaration ‚úÖ Yes Full function ‚úÖ Allowed
Function Expression Follows var/let/const rules Depends ‚ùå Error if before declaration
